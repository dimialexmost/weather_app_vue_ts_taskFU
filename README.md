This task is for students to show that students have the ability to identify the need and areas of use for web components, as well as to apply these in an event-driven program.  In the assignment, a weather page is described and while the choice of API is optional, openweather is suggested, which students already have some familiarity with. 
The project involves creating a page where users can search for weather in different locations. Furthermore, the page will also use the localStorage API to remember previously searched locations. Responsive design is not a requirement in this task.
Non-functional requirements (these must be met for an approved submission)

     The program is written with typescript.

     the any type should only be applied if the code becomes more scalable.

     The program is created with the latest version of vue.
     API calls are made with axios.
     Components are used where appropriate.

Weather side

The search page must contain a search field and information about the searched weather. The content should match the wireframe {weather app} below.

The information contained in the wireframe must also be contained in the finished implementation.

      Hourly forecast does not have to mean every hour as long as there are no more than 5 hour intervals, then the solution is approved.
     Weather icon is a graphic icon, see api (data source) under step 4 (further down) for example.
     The temperature must be stated in Celsius.
